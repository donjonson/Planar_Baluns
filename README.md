# Planar_Baluns
These python3 scripts use the python package gdspy to create GDS cells of planar baluns.
The motivation for these scripts is to simplify the generation of these complex structures for electromagnetic simulations.
Example scripts are provided for each class of balun.  Further details of the baluns are provided in the accompanying application note.
There are infinite ways to realize these types of baluns.  Three of which are explicated with the example scripts.

If the script 'Balun_X_Example.py' is properly executed, the following cell should be included in the gdspy layout viewer.

Likewise, 'Balun_XX_Example.py'.

![Alt text](/Balun_Images/Balun_XX_Example.jpg?raw=true "Optional Title")


And lastly, 'Balun_XI_Example.py'.
